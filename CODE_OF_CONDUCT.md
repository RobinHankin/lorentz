# Contributor covenant code of conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation
in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless.  We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to
an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Communicating respectfully with those of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the contributor covenant, version
2.1, available at
[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1].

## Note

Elisions follow an intent to foster a positive, respectful, and
inclusive community where contributors feel empowered to thrive.  I
choose to highlight and celebrate positive values and behaviours.  I
do not wish to dwell on---or even mention---the negative, as per
[WP:dont](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don%27t_stuff_beans_up_your_nose).
Eventually I will remove even this note, as it does not follow its own
advice.
