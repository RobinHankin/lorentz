In special relativity, the Lorentz transforms supersede their
classical equivalent, the Galilean transforms~\citep{goldstein1980}.
Lorentz transforms operate on four-vectors such as the four-velocity
or four-potential and are usually operationalised as multiplication by
a $4\times 4$ matrix.  A Lorentz transform takes the components of an
arbitrary four-vector as observed in one coordinate system and returns
the components observed in another system which is moving at constant
velocity with respect to the first.

There are a few existing software tools for working with Lorentz
transforms, mostly developed in an educational context.  Early work
would include that of \citet{horwitz1992} who describe {\tt relLab}, a
system for building a range of {\em gendanken} experiments in an
interactive graphical environment.  The author asserts that it runs on
``any Macintosh computer with one megabyte of RAM or more'' but it is
not clear whether the software is still available.  More modern
contributions would include the {\tt OpenRelativity}
toolkit~\citep{sherin2016} which simulates the effects of special
relativity in the {\tt Unity} game engine.

The R computer language~\citep{rcore2020} is usually used for
statistical computation but the language is sufficiently flexible to
be applied to diverse numerical disciplines such as complex
analysis~\citep{hankin2006}, recreational
mathematics~\citep{hankin2005}, and knot theory~\citep{hankin2017}.

The {\tt lorentz} package provides R-centric functionality for
relativistic velocity addition.  It deals with formal Lorentz boosts,
converts between three-velocities and four-velocities, and provides
computational support for the gyrogroup structure of relativistic
three-velocity addition.  Package source code is available on github
at \url{https://github.com/RobinHankin/lorentz}, and CRAN, at
\url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lorentz}.



\section{Lorentz transforms}

    #4\end{pmatrix}}


Here I will discuss (passive) Lorentz transforms in a computational
context.  Consider the following canonical Lorentz transform in which
we have motion in the $x$-direction at speed $v>0$; the motion is from
left to right.  A typical physical interpretation is that I am at
rest, and a colleague is in his spaceship moving at speed
$\BFu=\left(u,v,w\right)$ past me; we wonder what vectors which I
measure in my own rest frame look like to him.  The appropriate
coordinate transform would be:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma &-\gamma u&-\gamma v&-\gamma w\\
    -\gamma u&1+(\gamma-1)n_xn_x&(\gamma-1)n_xn_y&(\gamma-1)n_xn_z\\
    -\gamma v&(\gamma-1)n_yn_x&1+(\gamma-1)n_yn_y&(\gamma-1)n_yn_z\\
    -\gamma w&(\gamma-1)n_zn_x&(\gamma-1)n_zn_y&1+(\gamma-1)n_zn_z
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma=\left(1-\BFu\cdot\BFu\right)^{-1/2}$ and $n_x,n_y,n_z$
are the direction cosines of $\BFu$.  The package makes this type of
computation easy and employs natural R idiom.  Suppose, for example,
that $\BFu=\left(0.1,0.6,-0.4\right)$:

<<>>=
library("lorentz")
u <- as.3vel(c(0.1, 0.6, -0.4))
u
as.4vel(u)    # four-velocity is more useful in physics
@ 

The package employs a number of devices to ensure numerical stability.
For example, although $\gamma$ is calculated with package function
{\tt gam()}, in the classical limit of slow speeds we have $\gamma$
very close to 1; thus the speed of sound would have
$\gamma\simeq1+6.5\cdot 10^{-13}$.  The package provides function {\tt
  gamm1()} (named by analogy to {\tt expm1()}) which retains more
precision.  For more general work one usually uses boosts, $4\times 4$
transformation matrices:

<<>>=
boost(u) 
@ 

\section{Successive Lorentz transforms}

Coordinate transformation is effected by standard matrix
multiplication; thus composition of two Lorentz transforms is also
ordinary matrix multiplication:

<<>>=
u <- as.3vel(c(0.3,-0.4,+0.8))
v <- as.3vel(c(0.4,+0.2,-0.1))
(L <- boost(u) %*% boost(v))
@ 

But observe that the resulting transform is not a pure boost, as the
spatial components are not symmetrical\footnote{Identifying pure
  boosts with symmetric transformation matrices applies only if $c=1$.
  The package includes extensive capability for dealing with units in
  which $c\neq 1$, but the algebra becomes more complicated.}.  We may
decompose the matrix product $L$ into a pure translation composed with
an orthogonal matrix, which represents a coordinate rotation.  The
package provides extensive R idiom for effecting this composition.

\section{Three-velocities}

In contrast to four-velocities, three-velocities do not form a group
under composition as the velocity addition law is not
associative~\citep{ungar2006}.  Instead, three-velocity composition
has an algebraic structure known as a {\em gyrogroup} (this
observation was the original motivation for the package).
\citeauthor{ungar2006} shows that the velocity addition law for
three-velocities is

\begin{equation}
\BFu\oplus\BFv= \frac{1}{1+\BFu\cdot\BFv} \left\{ \BFu +
\frac{\BFv}{\gamma_\BFu} + \frac{\gamma_\BFu
  \left(\BFu\cdot\BFv\right)\BFu}{1+\gamma_\BFu} \right\}
\end{equation}
   
where~$\gamma_\BFu=\left(1-\BFu\cdot\BFu\right)^{-1/2}$ and we are
assuming~$c=1$.  \citeauthor{ungar2006} goes on to show that, in
general, $\BFu\oplus\BFv\neq\BFv\oplus\BFu$
and~$(\BFu\oplus\BFv)\oplus\BFw\neq\BFu\oplus(\BFv\oplus\BFw)$.  He also
defines the binary operator~$\ominus$
as~$\BFu\ominus\BFv=\BFu\oplus\left(-\BFv\right)$, and implicitly
defines~$\ominus\BFu\oplus\BFv$ to be~$\left(-\BFu\right)\oplus\BFv$.  If
we have

\begin{equation}
\gyr{u}{v}\BFx=-\left(\BFu\oplus\BFv\right)\oplus\left(\BFu\oplus\left(\BFv\oplus\BFx\right)\right)
\end{equation}

then

\begin{eqnarray}
\BFu\oplus\BFv &=&
\gyr{u}{v}\left(\BFv\oplus\BFu\right)\label{noncom}\\ \gyr{u}{v}\BFx\cdot\gyr{u}{v}\BFy
&=& \BFx\cdot\BFy\label{doteq}\\ \gyr{u}{v}\left(\BFx\oplus\BFy\right) &=&
\gyr{u}{v}\BFx\oplus\gyr{u}{v}\BFy\\ \left(\gyr{u}{v}\right)^{-1} &=&
\left(\gyr{v}{u}\right)\label{gyrinv}\\ \BFu\oplus\left(\BFv\oplus\BFw\right)
&=&\left(\BFu\oplus\BFv\right)\oplus\gyr{u}{v}\BFw\label{nonass1}\\ \left(\BFu\oplus\BFv\right)\oplus\BFw
&=&\BFu\oplus\left(\BFv\oplus\gyr{v}{u}\BFw\right)\label{nonass2}
\end{eqnarray}

Consider the following R session:

<<>>=
u <- as.3vel(c(-0.7,+0.2,-0.3))
v <- as.3vel(c(+0.3,+0.3,+0.4))
w <- as.3vel(c(+0.1,+0.3,+0.8))
@ 

Here we have three-vectors {\tt u} etc.  We can see that {\tt u} and
{\tt v} do not commute:

<<>>=
u+v
v+u
@ 

(the results differ).  We can verify equation~\ref{noncom}:

<<>>=
(u+v)-gyr(u,v,v+u)
@ 

showing agreement to within numerical error.  It is also possible to
use the functional idiom in which we define {\tt f()} to be the
map~$\BFx\mapsto\gyr{u}{v}\BFx$.

\subsection{Associativity}

Three-velocity addition is nonassociative, a phenomenon described as
``bizarre and counterintuitive'' by \cite{ungar1997}.  We can give a
clear numerical illustration of this using standard package idiom:

<<>>=
(u+v)+w
u+(v+w)
@ 

But we can use equations~\ref{nonass1} and~\ref{nonass2}:

<<>>=
(u+(v+w)) - ((u+v)+gyr(u,v,w))
((u+v)+w) - (u+(v+gyr(v,u,w)))
@ 

which verify the consistency of the gyrogroup structure of
three-velocity addition.

\subsection{Visualization of noncommutativity and nonassociativity
  of three-velocities}

Consider the following three-velocities:

<<>>=
u <- as.3vel(c(0.4,0,0))
v <- seq(as.3vel(c(0.4,-0.2,0)), as.3vel(c(-0.3,0.9,0)),len=20)
w <- as.3vel(c(0.8,-0.4,0))
@ 

Objects~$\BFv$ and $\BFw$ are single three-velocities, and object
$\BFv$ is a vector of three velocities.  We can see the
noncommutativity of three-velocity addition in figures~\ref{comfail1}
and~\ref{comfail2}, and the nonassociativity in figure~\ref{assfail}.

\caption{Failure\label{comfail1} of the commutative law for velocity

  velocity boosts of $+\BFu$ (purple), $+\BFv$ (black), $-\BFu$ (red),
  and~$-\BFv$ (blue) for $\BFu,\BFv$ as defined above.  Velocity $\BFu$ is
  constant, while $\BFv$ takes a sequence of values.  If velocity
  addition is commutative, the four boosts form a closed
  quadrilateral; the thick arrows show a case where the boosts almost
  close and the boosts nearly form a parallelogram.  The blue dots
  show the final velocity after four successive boosts; the distance
  of the blue dot from the origin measures the combined velocity,
  equal to zero in the classical limit of low speeds.  The discrepancy
  becomes larger and larger for the faster elements of the sequence
  $\BFv$}

\section{Distributivity in special relativity}

A relativistic three-velocity $\BFu$ may be ``multiplied'' by a scalar
$r$ with the law
$r\BFu=\tanh\left(r\tanh^{-1}\left|\left|\BFu\right|\right|\right)\BFu$,
thus for example $2\BFu=\BFu\oplus\BFu$~\citep{ungar1997}.
Three-velocities are not distributive in special relativity.  That is,
given three-velocities $\BFu$, $\BFv$ and a scalar $r$, we have that
$r(\BFu\oplus\BFv)\neq r\BFu\oplus r\BFv$ in general.
\cite{ungar1997} considers this and expresses the hope that one day a
gyrodistributive law expressing $r\left(\BFu\oplus\BFv\right)$ will be
discovered; and that, if it exists, is ``expected to be the standard
distributive law [i.e. $r\BFu\oplus r\BFv$] relaxed by Thomas gyration
in some unexpected way''.  The {\tt lorentz} package was written to
leverage the structure of R in the finding of a distributive law.  By
way of illustration, possible expressions for $r(\BFu\oplus\BFv)$ might
include

\begin{itemize}
\item $r\BFu  \oplus (r\BFv  \ominus \operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu, \BFv,\BFu\oplus\BFv])$
\item $r\BFu  \oplus (r\BFv  \ominus \operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu, \BFv,\BFv\oplus\BFu])$
\item $r\BFv  \oplus (r\BFu  \ominus r\operatorname{gyr}[s\BFu, \BFv,\BFu\oplus\BFv])$
\item $(r\BFu \oplus r\BFv)  \oplus r\operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu, \BFv,\BFu]$
\item $(r\BFu \oplus r\BFv)  \oplus r\operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu, \BFv,\BFv]$
\item $(r\BFu \oplus r\BFv)  \oplus \operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu, \BFv,\BFv]$
\item $(r\BFu \oplus r\BFv)  \oplus r\operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu,-\BFv,\BFv]$
\item $(r\BFu \oplus r\BFv)  \oplus   \operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu,-\BFv,\BFv]$
\item $(r\BFu \oplus r\BFv)  \oplus s\operatorname{gyr}[r\BFu,-\BFv,\BFv]$.
\end{itemize}

Here, $r$ is a scalar, $s=1/r$, and $\BFu$, $\BFv$ are three-velocities.
Note the variety of orders (three-velocity addition is not
commutative), different bracketing (three-velocity addition is not
associative), and use of $r$ or $s=1/r$ in different places in the
formula.  The {\tt lorentz package} facilitates a systematic sweep
through such plausible distributive laws, and the latest revision
searches a total of 688128 possibilities, unfortunately without
success.

\section{Conclusions}

The {\tt lorentz} package furnishes some functionality for
manipulating four-vectors and three-velocities in the context of
special relativity.  The R idiom is efficient and natural, and the
package illustrates different features of relativistic kinematics 
The package was used to carry out a systematic, but unsuccessful,
search for a distributive law.
