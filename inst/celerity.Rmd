In relativistic dynamics one usually uses three-velocity or four
velocity to describe instantaneous properties of timelike
trajectories.  The associated scalar quantity would be speed, the
magnitude of the three-velocity.  However, there are two other
measures that have pleasing properties: _celerity_ and _rapidity_.
These quantities have associated functionality in the lorentz package
which is shown here.
